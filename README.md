FullStack Coding Project
--------------

With this project we will assess your capacity to solve problems on your own and present a fully
working solution to a requested feature.
You will be given a chance to show your skills in web development: code, design, autonomy,
creativity, rigor, etc.
The project is about creating a small web application that runs simple analytics on data that
are fed by a third-party webservice (Github in this case), and to display results on a browser.

Analysis of the GitHub repository
--------------
GitHub is a Software as a Service (SaaS), that allows to host the source code of development
projects.
Given a project, it contains the history of commits and of actions.
GitHub provides a public API on https://developer.github.com/v4/?.

Specifications
--------------
By using the GitHub API (and any other public API you would want to use), your web application
must cover the following use cases:
1. A user should be able to look for a public project (also called repository) hosted on GitHub.
2. The user picks a repository among the search results.
3. Your application should then display 3 simple analytics for the selected project:
    - List of the committers (users) of the project
    - Taking into account the last 100 commits, impact of each user on the project (based on the
    number of commits)
    - Again on the last 100 commits, the projection of the commits on a timeline
4. This results page should be able to get bookmarked for later access.

Optional
--------------
Besides the features described above, you may add the following improvements:
- Dockerize your app and optionally deploying it on the cloud (for instance on
https://www.heroku.com)
- Add other types of analytics (if you are a data guru)
- Improve the user interface (Ajax, autocomplete, animations...) if you are an UX expert
- Expose the results on an API, if your passion is software design
- All of the above, if you are super(wo)man

Technical specifications
--------------
You can use the stack of your choice but you should have a backend exposing an API
consumed by a frontend. The result must be a web application.
Target a recent browser (Chrome/Firefox), so you don't have to stick to old technology.

Project presentation
--------------
Based on your experience and position you applied for, you have been given a certain amount
of days to complete this project. We expect you to send us a link to a public repository (github,
gitlab, bitbucket...) before the agreed limit date. We will then review your code and, if this first
internal review is positive, will ask you to come present the results of your work to us.
The presentation will allow you to explain your technical decisions, and the problems you
encountered.
Two items are essential: the final result, and the quality of your code.

Remarks
--------------
It is essential that your application works. Focus on this aspect first. If you are stuck with one of
the items, skip it and continue. Feel free to bring your 'personal touch' to the project.
Use tech with which you are comfortable - we don't assess based on a single tech, but based
on your ability to lead a project from scratch, managing all aspects.
Good luck!
